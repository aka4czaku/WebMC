This is the famous "[Atwood's law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/)" on the internet. After seeing this law, I've been eager to try to implement my favorite mc in js. I made it from scratch, without using any third-party libraries. Although many places will try to repeat the wheel, but I like the feeling of creating from scratch as you like. ~~(Although nothing is implemented now)~~

Although I know this statement is from _[the Principle of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html)_ and [Turing completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing _completeness) perspective ~~(probably)~~, but we still have to learn PHPer to a sentence: JavaScript is the world's best language.

# How to Run

Need to run on the server, because there are cross-domain issues with texture images.
If you have Node.js environment, then you can execute `node server.js` command to run a simple server, and then access it through `http://localhost:3000/`.
If the IDE you are using has its own static server function, then you can open the `/index.html` file in the browser through the IDE.
