This is the famous “[Atwood's Law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/)” on the web, after seeing this law, I have been eager to implement my favorite mc in js. I've been trying to implement my favorite mc in js since I saw it. Although many places will try to duplicate the wheel, but I like the feeling of creating from scratch as you wish. ~~(Though nothing has been realized yet) ~~

While knowing that this quote is from _[the Principle of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html)_ and [Turing Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing _completeness) ~~(probably)~~, but we still have to learn from PHPers: JavaScript is the best language in the world.

# How to Run

It needs to run on a server because of cross-domain issues with texture images.  
If you have a Node.js environment, you can run a simple server by executing the `node server.js` command, and then access it via `http://localhost:3000/`.  
If the IDE you are using has its own static server functionality, then you can open the `/index.html` file in a browser through the IDE.
